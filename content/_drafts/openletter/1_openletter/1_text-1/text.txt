Our current models are failing us. Individualism is degenerating into a fragmentation of shared reality. A financial system hostile to life on earth became an end in itself. The melting ice caps, diminishing coral reefs, disappearing coastlines and a dwindling biodiversity are confronting us with the limits of our excessive lifestyles. Meanwhile, digital media is feeding into our solipsism, atomizing us to the extent that objective truth dissolves and mutual trust dissipates. Extinction looms from all sides, while we are becoming increasingly paralyzed by the proliferation of mundane chatter that defines our everyday existence.

We call for the rehabilitation of collective action.

We live in a world of unconstrained intelligence: an indivisible, immaterial, and temporally undetermined network of relationships that we refuse to perceive as meaningfully alive.

What if our agency is inherently relational as well, and lies not in our autonomy but in our ability to build collective responsibility together?

What if the only way to get out of this state of mass paralysis is to let go of the notion of individual agency and embrace interdependence on a collective level?

We call for the inception of a new governance model.

New technologies are being commoditized faster than our ideological capacity is evolving to map out their long term consequences. Markets are operating at grave ecological consequences, failing to account for externalities and costs related to resources being limited.

The political class is disempowered and public regulation is ineffective in the face of rapid innovation: government legislation and incentives are failing to act on a global scale and likely to be out-of-date by the time they get implemented.

When both the public sector and the market economy are only perpetuating the crisis, we are in dire need of a new governance model that has the power to mobilize us from the perspective of a future where all life forms collectively thrive.

We call for a new era of mutuality.

We are emerging from a long era ruled by self-assertive forces into one that demands the rehabilitation of trust.

When the market economy is extractive and public regulation is too slow, we need a new, networked and resilient regulatory system that is able to act across borders and accommodate the need for adaptation.

To this end, we bring together institutions, organizations, communities, and individuals to unite under a networked governance model which builds on trust, peer accountability, and reciprocity.

If experts and organizations engage within a network that fosters a safe space for responsible leadership, emerging technologies will be kept in check by forces that are free from the corruption of growth-oriented practices.

In times of precarity, complexity and constant flux, we all need a present that moves towards a local, but globally interconnected, collaborative, participatory, and prosperous future.

We are facing real ecological deadlines and solutions can not emerge in isolation.

We call for a declaration of interdependence to:

- take full responsibility for a world we want to live in. 
- set goals collectively for a future we all want to share.
- advance these goals together transparently.
- hold each other accountable constructively.
- donâ€™t let each other fail.
