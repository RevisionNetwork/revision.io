We do this through a public online platform, the Transparency Database, and a peer accountability network of experts, organisations and institutional representatives. The database aggregates and catalogs ethical technology principles and organisational compliance objectives and it also serves as an open platform for raising concerns and pointing out tension areas related to specific principles and organisational objectives.

The ethical technology principles in the database are maintained by research institutions and individual experts working in the fields of cyberethics, technoethics, digital human rights, and corporate digital responsibility, while the related organizational ethical technology objectives are maintained by the organizations themselves.
