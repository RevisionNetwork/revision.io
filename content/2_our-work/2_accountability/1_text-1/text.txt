The REVISION network is a peer accountability network that operates with an active accountability mechanism.

Active, peer accountability means that there is mutual monitoring and real-time information sharing between the network members. Information, expertise, and resources are exchanged, while every implemented decision gets published in the Transparency Database real-time. This eliminates the need for retrospective demanding of accounts.
